                    <p class="aboutme_paragraph">
                        I'm Natalie and I've recently graduated from Chapman University with my Bachelors in Computer Science. But let's dive into who I really am beyond the textbooks and coding.
                        I grew up in Santa Ana, CA, along with my older brother and younger sister, in a bilingual Mexican household, surrounded by a large and supportive family. As a first-generation 
                        student, I have adapted to many new environments as I navigated collegiate life. My upbringing has instilled in me values of hard work and dedication. Whether it's in academics, athletics, 
                        personal pursuits, or relationships, I believe in giving my all. I'm also big on building strong connections, be it with partners, friends, or co-workers. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutme_paragraph_two">
                        In my free time, you'll find me enjoying all sorts of different hobbies, like losing myself in a good book or hitting the trails for a hike or a chill paddleboard session. I might be trying 
                        a new coffee shop on the way to a workout - recently tennis and pickleball have been my favorites. Oh, and let's not forget my inner gaming nerd.
                        Anyways, that's a bit about meâ€”let's chat soon!
