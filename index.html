                    <p class="aboutme_paragraph">
                        Hey there! I'm Natalie (or Nat) and I am currently attending Chapman University's Fowler School of Engineering, graduatins Spring 2024. The rest of this page is dedicated to my technical skills so let me
                         tell you a little bit more about who I am :)  I grew up as the eldest daughter in a bilingual, Mexican household in Santa Ana, CA. I have an enormous family who I could not be more 
                         grateful to have around me. I am also a first-generation college student and have been the 'first' for a lot of things in my family. I really love visiting my family Mexico and hope to 
                         be able to visit new places along the way. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutme_paragraph_two">
                         In terms of what I like to do, I would say my hobbies have remained fairly consistent throughout my childhood. On a day off, I will always enjoy a good book read, hiking, camping, or gaming session, paddleboarding,
                         sports workout (although I am partial to tennis and basketball) or puzzle moment. However, I have recently discovered pickleball, so I can add that to my list. Alright, it was nice to meet you and I hope we talk soon!
